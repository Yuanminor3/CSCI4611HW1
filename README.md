Writing an application in GopherGfx that re-implements one of our favorite interactive art installations, Text Rain by Romy Achituv and Camille Utterback. This is a fun, engaging projection-based digital installation that has stood the test of time.  The artwork is in three permanent collections and has been exhibited dozens of times around the world.
